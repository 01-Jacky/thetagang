# ThetaGang

ThetaGang is an [IBKR](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) trading bot for
collecting premium by selling options using "The Wheel" strategy. The Wheel
is a strategy that [surfaced on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/),
but has been used by many in the past. This bot implements a slightly
modified version of The Wheel, with my own personal tweaks.

I've been streaming most of the work on this project [on Twitch, so follow me
over there](https://www.twitch.tv/letsmakestuff).

## Requirements

The bot is based on the [ib_insync](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync)
library, and uses [IBC](https://github.com/IbcAlpha/IBC) for managing the API
gateway.

To use the bot, you'll need an Interactive Brokers account with a working installation of IBC. Additionally, you'll need an installation of Python 3.8 or newer with the [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager.

## Getting Started

Check out the code to your local machine and install the Python dependencies:

```shell
$ poetry install
```
